#Current Progress:
- Week 1: Accomplish the thesis proposal; Read Papers to understand the electrophysiological mechanism of local field potential in different experimental setups; Define the first version of biophysical model (including its related network structure) and applied it to simulating neuronal data;
- Week 2: Replant codes from Windows platform to Linux platform;
- Week 3: Start to test the origin of time delay of the MI peak. Find its dependency from neuronal parameters as well as network setup;
- Week 4: Add auto-control script in python for simulation program, find properties of TDMI figure according to different composition of neuronal current sources and verify them with larger simulation testing pool;

#Plans:
- Week 5-8: Test LFP model based on simulating data, and modified it step by step;
- Week 9 (Apr 23): Mid-term thesis defense;
- Week 10-15: Apply TDMI method on experimental data and compare results with those from simulation.
- Week 16 (Jun 7): Final thesis defense;
