# Current Progress:

1. Finished integrate-and-fire network programming;
2. Finished LFP modeling and programming;
3. Finished time-delayed mutual information programming;
4. Running simulations of regular connected networks;
5. Running tests of joint analysis of spike and LFP;

# Results:

1. Mutual information can indicate the physical directions of information flows in networks.
2. The intensity of TDMI signal depends on network activities.

# Problems and Methods to solve it:

1. Time-delayed linear-based correlation reveals the properties of current simulating system with similar results. More simulations within different dynamical regions are required to compare the difference between the methods of TDMI and Time-delayed linear correlation.

# Plans and way to solve it:

1. Go further with theorems to explain the details about how TDMI revails the relationship between two physical systems;
2. More simulating tests should be done under different dynamical regions.
